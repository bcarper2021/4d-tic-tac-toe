# 4d-tic-tac-toe
3D tic-tac-toe game with a cube that can be flipped adding an extra dimension of complexity

Only the Unity asset folder has been included here as the rest of the code generated is mostly boilerplate.

Most of the work I have done with this project has been through the unity editor. Scripts written to aid the editor and govern the game mechanics are contained in the Scripts folder.
